    # General Paragraph
    HTML("<p>Please note that the graphs and map might take some time to load.<br>
  The following app takes a look at a portion of a dataset from Kaggle.com pertaining to Bigfoot sightings.  The portion includes dates from January 1, 2000 to the most recent data.<br>
  The dataset can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chemcnabb/bfro-bigfoot-sighting-report.<br>
  
  Five sections can be accessed from the tabs at the top of the screen.<br> 
  The first shows our unaltered information.  It is simply the number of times each month a sighting of Bigfoot was recorded.<br>
  The second displays three ways of looking at the data from a seasonal standpoint.  These can be toggled between using radio buttons under the Choose Graph: heading.<br>
  The third displays how each month compares to other months.<br>
  The fourth tab shows a decomposition of our data into seasonal, trend, and irregular components.<br>
  Month and year of each point can be seen by hovering your cursor over the point on the graph. <br>
  The fifth tab includes forecasts for two years after our data.  The radio buttons allow for examination of four different methods of prediction. <br>
  At the bottom of each page, there is a world map that allows for further inspection into the series.  If there is a specific time in the data that you would like to investigate, that time frame can be selected within the Date Range.
  That range will be reflected in the timeline at the bottom of the screen.  By pressing play, an animation will begin that shows the locations of sightings during that month.  To pause or search within the animation, you can click or drag the circle on the timeline.  The map can be zoomed in on by using the buttons in the top right corner of the map section.<br>
  My analysis of each section is below the plots for that tab.

                average error per sighting, about 0.03 less than the Exponential
                Smoothing model. However, the Exponential Smoothing model was 
                approximately 15% more precise in capturing the overall trend and
                seasonal patterns compared to the ARIMA model. This means it more
                accurately reflected the ups and downs seen in the actual data. 
                While both ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing are good options, I
